Nagios has been around for quite some time, but producing output it can 
consume is something of a black art. Only the plugin documentation 
actually explains what all the extra semicolons or extended formatting 
even means.

This is especially onerous when performance consuming add-ons expect a 
specific structure before operating properly. This package strives to 
greatly simplify the process of actually generating Nagios output using 
Python.

Please see the TODO file for a very rudimentary roadmap for this
project! Development should pick up after the move to github thanks
to the increase in volunteers.
